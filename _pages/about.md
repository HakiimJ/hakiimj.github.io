Hi there!

Hakiim Jamaluddin is a full time Ph.D (Mathematics) student at UNSW Sydney, Australia and a young academic (Statistics and Data Science) at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia. My current laboratories are UNSW Data Science Hub (uDASH) led by [Professor Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/Welcome.html) and Transitional Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TransAI) led by [Dr. Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra). Scott and Rohit are amazingly patient with good sense of humour!

Hakiim is a minimalist, evening-jogger, coffee-man. He plays table tennis sometimes (learnt it from his dad since 10 so do not challenge him if you are not ready to lose). He loves the nature especially the ocean, lake, etc.

His previous webpage is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/hakiimj/).
