Hi there! I work best in the morning, jog in the evening and watch movies at night. My previous webpage is [here](https://sites.google.com/view/hakiimj/).

About me
======
I am a full time Ph.D (Mathematics) student at UNSW Sydney, Australia and a young academic (Statistics and Data Science) at Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia. My current laboratories are UNSW Data Science Hub (uDASH) led by [Professor Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/Welcome.html) and Transitional Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TransAI) led by [Dr. Rohitash Chandra](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-rohitash-chandra). Scott and Rohit are amazingly patient and funny!

I am a minimalist, evening-jogger, coffee-man. I play table tennis sometimes (learnt it from my dad since 10, do not challenge me if you are not ready to lose). I love watery nature especially the ocean, lake, etc. I love some animals but I do not touch them. I do more of listening than talking.
