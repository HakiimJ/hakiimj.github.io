  <h3>Symbolic Data Analysis</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Beranger (2023) proposed a new Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) approach that models classical data directly, treating symbolic random variables as summaries to tackle challenges with large, complex datasets. Unlike Le-Rademacher and Billard (2011) and Brito and Silva (2012), who used assumptions about symbolic data statistics like mid-points and log-ranges, Zhang, Beranger, and Sisson (2020) and Beranger (2023) developed a likelihood-based framework for fitting models at the classical data level, even with only symbolic data observed. My group extends this by focusing on optimal designs for symbolic data and applying SDA to statistical methods, including mixture models, enhancing their practical utility.<br>

  <h3>Computational Statistics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Computational statistics involves the development and application of computational methods to analyse and interpret complex data, often using algorithms and simulations to solve statistical problems. It encompasses techniques like Monte Carlo methods, machine learning, and data visualisation to extract insights from large datasets. By leveraging high-performance computing, it enables efficient processing of statistical models for real-world applications. My group focuses on advancing these techniques, primarily using R and Python, to tackle sophisticated data analysis challenges.<br>
