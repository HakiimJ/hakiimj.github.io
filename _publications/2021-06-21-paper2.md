The second preliminary study to understand the effects of data-level resampling methods in class imbalance using leave-one-out cross-validation, k-fold cross-validation, repeated k-fold cross-validation, naive bootstrap, and .632+ bootstrap. The second manuscript produced from a MSc thesis entitled "Classification for large number of variables with two imbalanced groups".
